# COVID19-Tracker

<p> An application that I developed using <strong>React</strong>.</p>
<p> For this application I used <strong>disease.sh API</strong> in order to get data related to the
    COVID19 status amongst all the countries in the world. </p>
<p> I used <strong>material-ui</strong> in order to have some predefined styled components. </p>
<p> For the <strong>map creation</strong> I used <strong> react-leaflet </strong></p>
<p> For the <strong>chart creation</strong> I used <strong> react-chartjs-2 </strong> <p>
<p> The <strong>deployment</strong> was done using <strong> Firebase </strong><p>
